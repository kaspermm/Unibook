# Unibook
The projectâ€™s purpose has been to develop a database system with a specific use case and incorporate the principles and concepts of object-oriented analysis, design, and programming into the development process.
The system design is implemented using Bootstrap, Entity Framework, and ASP.NET, which help us build a website using HTML, CSS, and C#. The result of this project is unibook.me, an online marketplace for selling used books. The website is connected to a database
that stores information about the different books, listings, and users.
